### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)**
```
Priority: MEDIUM | Success Rate: 80% | Estimated Time: 3-4 hours
```

7. **Implement Real State Management** 🔄
   - Add Zustand as claimed in documentation
   - Fix React Context re-render issues
   - Files: `lib/state/`, `contexts/GameContext.tsx`

8. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling** 🛡️
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery systems for failed operations
   - Files: `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `lib/error-handling/`

9. **Implement Achievement System** 🏆
   - Working achievement system with unlock conditions
   - Files: `lib/achievements/`, `components/Achievements.tsx`

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (performance-optimized)
- **State**: React Context (with memoization)
- **API**: OpenFoodFacts API with fallback
- **Testing**: Jest, Puppeteer for E2E
- **Port Management**: Environment-based configuration

## 🎮 **GAME MECHANICS**

### **Core Gameplay Loop**
1. **Search** → Find consumables via real API
2. **Add to Inventory** → Collect items for experiments
3. **Lab Mixing** → Combine consumables safely
4. **Experiment Results** → Get safety scores and recommendations
5. **Progression** → Unlock new features and consumables

### **Safety Analysis Engine**
- Medical-grade calculations for interactions
- Safety scoring system (Safe, Caution, Warning, Danger, Lethal)
- Real-time recommendations
- User profile-based safety assessment

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT & CONFIGURATION**
